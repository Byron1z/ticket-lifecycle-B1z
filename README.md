<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h3>Intake</h3>
<p>
  As an End-User, Marianne creates the following ticket: "The entire mobile/online banking system is down".

  In this scenario, this ticket will be Critical - could be considered a "Sev-A".

</p>
<br />

<h3>Ticket Assignment</h3>
<p>
  As a Help Desk Agent (Hilda), she will observe the ticket’s properties
  
  Log in as Hilda.
</p>
<p>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iDYSnGX.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Hilda observes the ticket.

</P>
<br />
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>
  When Observing the ticket, we see there are categories where Agent Hilda could set to this particular ticket such as

  - Priority
  
  - Department
 
  - Assigned To

  - SLA Plan

Agent Hilda will set properties on the ticket.

Agent Hilda sees this is a "Sev-A" emergency ticket and has to reassign the ticket to a System Administrator.
</p>

</P>
<p>
  Edit: You should also set the Priority Level of the ticket. The Priority should be set to "Emergency" since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire portion of the business.

  In this lab, I forgot to show this; Here's an example of what it would look like.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IMmA2fi.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Set the Preferred Help Topic
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NIIXDj5.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/64zTj7I.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Agent Hilda will send it to the appropriate department/team "Online Banking" for Troubleshooting, which the Online Banking Department would handle this sort of issue,

  Or it could also be sent to the Systems Administrator's Department, but for this lab we'll try to keep it consistent.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p> 
  For convenience, Byron, the System Administrator and the Supreme Admin, will also be a member of the online banking team. 
</p>
<br />

<h3>Working the Issue</h3>
<p>
  Work on the ticket to completion as Byron, the Supreme Admin.
</p>
<p>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KJfBQ9X.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Byron will Assign the ticket to himself.
</p>
<p>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8yIbuKX.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Post a Reply to keep agents updated on the ticket's solution.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/r6k4rQr.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Now Troubleshoot the Problem with the IT Support Team and get back to the Agents.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/UKQlUay.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Support agent Hilda sees in her portal that Systems Administrator agent Byron has left a message and that the ticket has now been Resolved.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>
  Now, Set the Ticket to Resolved.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xB8b9Yi.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hydA985.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Once resolved, it shouldn’t appear anymore on the portal. 

  To see Resolved and Closed Tickets, you can log in as the Admin User and go to Tickets, Closed, and choose a certain time when the ticket was Resolved or Closed.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<h3>Second Example</h3>
<p>
  Here’s a second example of a Ticket. For this Ticket, the end-user will inform the support team that the CFO's laptop is having Computer Problems.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tn9AlxM.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Again, we will log in as a Support Agent, who will be Hilda.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GRbr1q7.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Since this Ticket involves a problem with the CFO's (Chief Financial Officer) laptop, we’ll set the Priority to "Emergency" for this scenario.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uNr9THJ.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  For SLA, we’ll set it to "Sev-B" since the Ticket description does not indicate it is to be immediately fixed.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TSqXmxr.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Support Agent Hilda will assign it to herself.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fqTFDNL.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Next, we will respond to end-user Marianne by email or phone for more clarity on the situation, since the CFO may not be available. 
  
  After we troubleshoot the problem, we will respond to the Ticket.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EXPUkGx.png" height="80%" width="90%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, once we solve the issue, close the Ticket with the Resolved option.

</p>
<br />
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  These 2 examples were very simplistic, basic scenarios of the creation of tickets by end-users, employees, etc., showing how the ticket is assigned and displaying the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.

Additional scenarios can also occur while a ticket is being assessed. Depending on the business impacts, a ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in Severity Level, or both reassigned to a more qualified Agent/Department to troubleshoot the issue.
