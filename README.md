<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>
  When Observing the ticket, we see there's categories where Agent Hilda could set to this particular ticket such as

  Priority
  
  Department
 
Assigned To

SLA Plan

Agent Hilda will Set Properties to the ticket,

Agent Hilda sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.

  Agent Hilda will send it to the appropriate department "Online Banking" for Troubleshooting, which the Online Banking Department would handle this sort of issue,

  or it could also be sent to the Systems Administrator's Department, but for this lab we'll try to keep it consistent.
